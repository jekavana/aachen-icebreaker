One day, I was just sitting around in my Lederhose working on GitHub, when I had
the best schnapsidee.

I hurried down the haupstrasse towards the flughafen. 

To my surprise, there was Schneewittchen, waiting to board a flight.

When I approached her, she offered me a bite of her bratwurst.

After my bite, I introduced her to Musik I made. 

Hearing the first track, she said she would rather listen to the Klimaanlage.

Those remarks sent me into a terrible bout of kopfkino.

So, I asked Schneewittchen if she wanted to listen to the Klimaanlage in my BMW
instead.

She said no, and that it was time for her to board her flight to Rammstein in order to 
make it to the party in the ratskeller. 

I said, "Oh, are you also on your way to the secret biergarten?" What a coincidence!

"I'll be going in my slick Lederhose since it's happening in Berlin", I stated, hoping 
we were going to the same place.

As she left for her flight without responding I realized it was but a luftschloss, for I was too distracted by her Dirndel to realize that Rammstein and Berlin were on the opposite sides of Germany.
