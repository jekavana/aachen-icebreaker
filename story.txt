One day, I was just sitting around in my Lederhose working on GitHub, when I had
the best schnapsidee.

I hurried down the haupstrasse towards the flughafen. 

To my surprise, there was Schneewittchen, waiting to board a flight.

When I approached her, she offered me a bite of her bratwurst.

After my bite, I introduced her to Musik I made. 

Hearing the first track, she said she would rather listen to the Klimaanlage.

Those remarks sent me into a terrible bout of kopfkino.

So, I asked Schneewittchen if she wanted to listen to the Klimaanlage in my BMW
instead.

She said no, and that it was time for her to board her flight to Rammstein in order to 
make it to the party in the ratskeller. 

I said, "Oh, are you also on your way to the secret biergarten?" What a coincidence!
